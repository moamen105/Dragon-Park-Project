# Technical Questions

1. Uptime Guarantee (99.99%)
To achieve a 99.99% uptime guarantee, the following strategies are implemented:

- Use a reliable hosting service with a history of high availability.
- Implement redundancy and failover mechanisms to handle server failures.
- Regularly monitor and log application performance, setting up alerts for potential issues.
- Deploy updates during low-traffic periods to minimize disruptions.

2. Handling Scale for 1 Million Dragons
To handle a significant increase in scale (1 million dragons), consider the following:

- Optimize database queries and indexing for efficient data retrieval.
- Use a more scalable database solution (e.g., PostgreSQL) if needed.
- Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data.
- Use load balancing and auto-scaling for the web server to distribute traffic.
- Consider asynchronous processing for resource-intensive tasks.
